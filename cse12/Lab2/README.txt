Lab 2: Simple Data Path
-----------
DESCRIPTION
In this lab, the user store values from 0 to F in 4 different registers. The user can input a number to store using a keypad.
The user can also compute an arithmetic operation using an ALU. This ALU takes two registers as input, arithmetically left shifting the 
second input by the other to compute the output. This output can be stored in a registry by using a switch.
The user can store the number to be stored into the specified registry by clicking an update button.
The user can also reset all the registries to 0 by clicking a reset button.
